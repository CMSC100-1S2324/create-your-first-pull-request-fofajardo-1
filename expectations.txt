# Expectations for the CMSC 100 Course

**Francis Dominic Fajardo:**
Based on the course outline, we will learn and tackle each component of the
web stack, starting from the front-end, the basics of HTML/CSS/JS, the
back-end, which includes the database and related server software.

With the help and guidance of our professor, I believe that we will be able
to overcome the challenges we'll face, especially with the lab exercises.
Since I have some prior experience with web development, I think it won't
be overly-difficult to learn and understand the concepts that will be
discussed throughout the semester.
