# Expectations for the CMSC 100 Course

**Francis Dominic Fajardo:**
Based on the course outline, we will learn and tackle each component of the
web stack, starting from the front-end, the basics of HTML/CSS/JS, the
back-end, which includes the database and related server software.

With the help and guidance of our professor, I believe that we will be able
to overcome the challenges we'll face, especially with the lab exercises.
Since I have some prior experience with web development, I think that this
will lessen, to some extent, the difficulty of trying to learn and understand
the concepts that will be discussed throughout the semester.

# I agreed with what you said there. It's not news now to me that this will
# be a hard subject to take. I take it that there are really valuable skills
# that could come from this course even if you aren't planning touching
# web development in the future. Good Luck to you too on this course!
